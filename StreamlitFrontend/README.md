## Create an environment using venv

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.
```
cd myproject
```
In your terminal, type:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.


## Activate your environment
In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.
```
# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"


## Deactivate venv
When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:
```
deactivate
```

## Run you app
```
streamlit run app.py
```
If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:
```
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```
