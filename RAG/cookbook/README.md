## Install Pinecone
Ready to get started with Pinecone? First, install the Python SDK:
```
pip install pinecone
```

## Initialize
Next, use your API key to initialize your client:
```
from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec

pc = Pinecone(api_key="********-****-****-****-************")
```

## Create index
Then [create an index](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/index-data/create-an-index) that is integrated with an embedding model hosted by Pinecone. With integrated models, you upsert and search with text and have Pinecone generate vectors automatically.

```
index_name = "developer-quickstart-py"

if not pc.has_index(index_name):
    pc.create_index_for_model(
        name=index_name,
        cloud="aws",
        region="us-east-1",
        embed={
            "model":"llama-text-embed-v2",
            "field_map":{"text": "chunk_text"}
        }
    )
```
